# Challenge_of_Knowledge_Game

- A fun and educational game that enhances knowledge and thinking skills for children.

## Project Idea

- Challenge of Knowledge is an educational and entertaining web game designed to develop children's mental skills, general knowledge, and language abilities through three interactive stages.

## 🎮 Game Stages

- Random Letters Game

- The player must arrange English letters in the correct order to complete a given sentence.

- Random letter boxes appear on the screen.

- The player clicks the correct letters in sequence.

- Each round lasts 30 seconds ⏱️. 

- If time runs out before completion, the player loses the round and a new sentence appears.

- The goal is to collect as many correct sentences as possible, making learning fun and engaging.

## 🧩 2. Complete the Word

- The player sees incomplete words and must select the correct missing letters to finish them.

- This stage enhances language comprehension, focus, and attention to detail.

## 🕌 3. Islamic Knowledge Questions

- A quiz-based stage that tests players’ knowledge of Islamic teachings and values.

- Encourages thinking, understanding, and reflection while learning more about Islam in a modern, interactive way.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The player navigates through stages that mix fun with education.

- Each stage presents a different challenge that improves logic, memory, and language skills.

- A timer adds excitement and encourages quick thinking.

- Designed with child-friendly visuals and engaging animations.
